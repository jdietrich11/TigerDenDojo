      "For a long time, I had never considered the need to involve myself in any kind of self defense. My brother had grown up going to karate, but for whatever reason I found no interest in it, and was always afraid that, even in adulthood, if I did karate I would get hurt a ton or have great difficulty due to my small size and stature. Eventually, my husband started doing karate with a local dojo Brandon worked at, and before I knew it, I began to have the itch to go with him as well to give karate a shot. I found myself surprised to find that even if there were rougher students who lacked control, who scared me or made me feel uncomfortable, Brandon Chambers was always quick to correct them, and though Brandon is twice my size and is built like a bull, I never felt intimidated or was EVER  injured during his instruction. I mention this fact because at the time, there were other teachers working with him in the former dojo he was employed at who had accidentally harmed me on several occasions which left me in tears and with bruises and sprains. I’ll reiterate that this NEVER  occurred, even when sparring, with Sensei Chambers. My husband and I eventually left that former dojo because of how uncomfortable it was under these other instructors, and happily continued our instruction alone with Brandon after he founded his own dojo. He was extremely disciplined, helpful, motivated, and never hesitated to instruct with kindness and pertinence. Under his instruction I was taught  ways to use my small size to my advantage, how to evade and block strikes, beautiful and complex forms and defenses, and discipline. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to be taught by such a thoughtful instructor who was always personally invested in my success and learning. I would highly recommend Brandon Chambers over any other sensei, local or otherwise. If you are a woman who wants to try self defense, but is hesitating thinking you’ll get hurt, be belittled, or mistreated, you should go to no one else but Tiger Den! You won’t find any of that sort of malpractice in this incredible dojo.",

      "Sensei Chambers is an excellent martial artist. I was taught by him for a few years before and worked side by side with him in teaching for another seven or more years. He was there through my own martial arts journey, during which he was a key help in my progression. His technique is precise, teaching top notch, and attitude is always positive. I would highly recommend Sensei Chambers as a martial arts instructor.",
