    question: "How long will it take me to get to Black Belt?",
    answer: [
      "This is corny, but it’s true: everybody has a different journey to Black Belt. That being said, I’ve designed the curriculum in such a way that an adult of average capabilities should be able to obtain their Black Belt in 500-750 hours. This means that an adult, practicing for 2 hours per week, should be able to obtain their black belt in 5-7 years. Somebody who puts in 3-4 hours per week could reasonably do it in as little as 3-4 years. For young children, it can take longer, especially because we do have age requirements for some of the higher ranks.",

    question: "How does Belt Advancement work?",
    answer: [
      "For each belt, you will learn 1-2 Kata, a few Defenses or a Flow Drill, a weapon Kata, and some new strikes, blocks, and kicks. Once you’ve learned these requirements and sufficiently improved your overall skill, you will be invited to a belt test (which we usually refer to as Evaluations). If you feel you are nearly ready and haven’t yet been invited to be Evaluated yet, ask a Sensei. Every Evaluation includes physical requirements (a run, pushups, and situps), comprehensive review of all curriculum requirements, Kumite (sparring), and board breaking.",

    question: "Is it REAL self-defense?",
    answer: [
      "I am of the belief that there are roughly 5 levels of defense:",
      "1) Preventative self defense",
      "2) Long-Range Weapons Defense (firearms)",
      "3) Short-Range Weapons Defense (knives, bottles, bats,etc...)",
      "4) Mid-Range Hand-To-Hand combat. (Strikes, Punches, and Kicks)",
      "5) Grappling. (Anything fom the clinch to the ground.)",
      "With that in mind, Shoukendou is LARGELY focused on the 4th level, with elements of Level 3 and Level 5 sprinkled throughout the curriculum. So, yes, this is real self-defense. We simply keep our focus on those particular levels.",
      "When considering Self-Defense, I (and most everybody else in this field) understand that the MOST HIGH VALUE LEVEL of Self-Defense is Level 1: Preventative Self-Defense. If you want to get really good at Self-Defense as quickly as possible, you need to get good at practicing Preventative Self-Defense. If you’re practicing that correctly, the odds are highly in your favor that you’ll never need to know anything from Levels 2-5. Because I really believe in this, I want to elaborate a little bit further on what good Preventative Self-Defense looks like.",
      "Sensei Chambers' 3 Rules of Preventative Self-Defense:",
      "1) Avoid ego, both in yourself, and in those you choose to associate with.",
      "2) Avoid alcohol and other recreational mind-altering substances. Avoid consuming them yourself, and avoid those who are actively consuming them.",
      "3) Avoid being in stupid places, at stupid times, doing stupid things, with stupid people.",
      "These three rules are far more valuable than anything you can learn from the other 4 levels, and I really mean that. Too many people don’t understand the value of Mr. Miyagi’s wise advice: “Best way to avoid punch: no be there.” I teach martial arts because I want you to be safe and have fun. I wouldn’t be helping you stay safe if I didn’t encourage you to follow these three rules.",
