After taking a break from web design to persue other interests, (UE5, Blender, C++, and more). I returned after a friend of mine asked for assistance designing a website for his small buisness. I advised he use one of the web builder websites so he could have complete control over it, not need to rely on me for making changes, etc... he chose weebly. Still I assisted where I could. I decided then to try and copy/improve on what he had built. You can find his version of the website at (https://www.tigerdendojo.com/). I used react to create my version and I implamented a change he wished he could make, more FAQ items as he is just limited to 5. I made mine infinite in #'s that could be asked. Most of the changes however, are just simple design differences.

It was a lot of fun to get back into web development. I liked having to solve different problems and get back into the flow. I really had fun building the FAQ dropdowns and they were also my biggest struggle. They were the only thing I used state usestate for and needed a refresher. I also really enjoyed piecing together the carousel on the testimonials page. it added some motion to an otherwise motionless website.
